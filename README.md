# Authentication from Scratch with Bcrypt

The goal of this project is to learn and serve as a practical demonstration of building a secure authentication system from scratch. We go through the concepts of Hashing functions, Salts, Bcrypt, Sessions, etc.

This full-stack project demonstrates a robust authentication system built entirely from scratch. Using Node.js and Express for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and EJS for templating, this project showcases the implementation of secure user authentication, including user registration, login, and logout functionalities.

**Key Features:**

* **Secure Authentication:** Passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt to ensure user data remains protected.
* **Session Management:** Utilizes sessions for user authentication, ensuring a seamless and secure browsing experience.
* **MongoDB Integration:** Stores user data in a MongoDB database, showcasing practical database integration in a Node.js application.
* **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface, ensuring compatibility across devices.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, EJS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Database:** MongoDB
